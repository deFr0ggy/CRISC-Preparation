# Domain 2.1 - Introduction to Information Security Risks

Chapter provides the basic understanding of Risk Management Concepts. 

### Risk 
	- Risk is something unknown.
	- It is the combination of probability and impact.
	
When you have low probability and low impact risk. Then we don't have the huge potential for loss. But if it is high probability and high impact, thats when we are required to derive the mitigation steps and processes. 

Formula for calculating RISK 

	- Risk = Asset x Threat x Probability 

Once the risk is known then it is required to be mitigated. It can be positive and negative.

	- Positive Risk is an opportunity
	- Negative Risk is a threat

There are several factors which are required to be considered while evaluating the risk.

- Organization
	- Risk Management strategy is required to be aligned with the organizations mission strategy. 
-  Assets 
	-  Things which we value
- Threats
	- Anything that will harm the organization/assets
- Vulnerabilities 
	- Weaknesses
- Likelihood
	- Chances of something to happen. It can be an disaster, exploit or anything.
- Impact
	- If something is exploited how much it impact the organization whether physically, financially etc.

`
It is to be noted that if there is no asset there will be no RISK and if there is no threat then also there is going to be no RISK and it is all being calculated via the RISK Formula.
