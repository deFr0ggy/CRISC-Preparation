# 5.16 Selecting a Mitigation Strategy

## 1. Control Design and Implementation

- Controls may be proactive (safeguards) or reactive (countermeasures).
- Risk assessment should determine the effectiveness of current controls to mitigate risk.
- In case where current controls are not sufficient, controls must be adjusted or new controls implmented.

## 2. Vulnerabilities Associated with New Controls

- New controls present benefits as well as new risk and vulnerabilities
- Example - An Access Control System
	- Pro -Protects from unauthorized access
	- Con - Affect normal users who forgot passwords, resulting inn increased denial of service and more calls for technical assistance.

## 3. Cost Benefit Analysis
- Used to justify expense associated with the control
- Factors used in calculating the total cost of the control
	- Cost of acquisition
	- Ongoing cost of maintenance
	- Cost to remove/replace control
- Factors used in calculating benefit realized from the control
	- Reduced cost of risk event
	- Reduced liability
	- Reduced insurance premiums increased customer confidence
	- Trust from financial backers. Fast Recovery
	- Better Employee Relations

## Return on Investment
- Method of justifying an investment
- Can be difficult to determine cost of control because it is hard to predict the likelihood of an attack.
- Return on security investment refers to ROI in relation to payback for security controls
	-	Cost may or may not provide a direct benefit in the future, like the purchase of insurance.
