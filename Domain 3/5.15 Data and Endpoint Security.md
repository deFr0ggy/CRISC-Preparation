# 5.15 Data and Endpoint Security

## Endpoint Protection

- Hardening Systems
	- Remove Unnecessary Services
	- Path Systems
	- Rename guest and administrative accounts
	- Review default setting and configurations
	- Install anti-malware and monitoring software
	- Images are often used to deploy baseline O/S and applications
	- Configuration management requires changes to be controlled and documented
	- Remote access tools are often used by the network team to provide assistance and remote admin if needed
	- Many devices have remote destruction capabilities in case of loss or compromise
	- Data should be encrypted for the sake of provacy
	- VDI relies on highly controlled servers running the apps users work with. Client system work as a terminal or thin clients.

## Data Security
- Confidentiality 
	- Data at Rest - Encryption
	- Data in Motion - Secure Transport Protocols
	- Data in Use - Homomorphic Encryption
- Integrity 
	- Hashes/Message Digests
-  Availability
	-   Redundancy
-  Non-Repudiation
	-  Digital Signatures
- Data traversing unsecured networks can have end-to-end security through the use of VPNs.
