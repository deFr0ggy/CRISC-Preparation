# CRISC-Preparation
I have created this reporsitory to keep all my notes at one place which I have took during the time I was studying CRISC Course from Cybrary. 

The folders are divided in the same manner as the course is designed.

1. Preliminary 
2. Domain 1
3. Domain 2
4. Domain 3
5. Domain 4

The course can be enrolled into for this month only i.e. March 2021.
